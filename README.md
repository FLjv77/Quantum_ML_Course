### **Why Quantum Machine Learning?**  
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to enhance classical ML algorithms. With **PennyLane**, you can design and optimize quantum circuits just like neural networks, enabling hybrid quantum-classical models for:  
- 🔍 **Faster optimization** in high-dimensional spaces  
- 💡 **Novel algorithms** (e.g., quantum kernels, QNNs)  
- ⚡ **Quantum advantage** for specific tasks  

### **Why PennyLane?**  
- 🐍 **Python-first** – Seamless integration with NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow  
- ⚙️ **Hardware-agnostic** – Run circuits on simulators or real quantum computers
